# Kearney-Procurement-System
This document serves to summarize the project scope and output from my work with Kearney Procurement System (KPS). 


## Project Scope
KPS is an internally funded initiative aimed to bolster Kearney’s procurement offering through the implementation of digital procurement solutions as well as the addition of partnerships with solutions providers to enhance our capabilities for clients.  My objective was the following:

- Assist in the development of applications that would aid full-time consultants in the delivery of their projects (user journey creation and business requirement documentation)
- Collect and Clean relevant data to stand up Proof of Concepts within the first few months of development
- Conduct Market Research in the commodities risk management space to understand existing solutions and to determine a plan to build Kearney’s offering
